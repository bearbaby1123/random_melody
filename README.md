# random_melody

This project aims to generate random melodies.
The intervallic_lick.py file receives a root as its input and generates a short random melody from an interval view.
The rm.py file generates a random melody and accompanies it with jazz chords, which might sound a bit fusion and exciting due to the chords contains randomly selected 7th and 9th notes.
