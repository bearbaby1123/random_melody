# Random-Melody

This project aims to generate random melodies using rule-based methods. I intend to further employ EA and deep learning methods, such as GAN or Transformer, for this task.

## Feature
The intervallic_lick.py file receives a root as its input and generates a short random melody from an interval view.
The rm.py file generates a random melody and accompanies it with jazz chords, which might sound a bit fusion and exciting due to the chords contains randomly selected 7th and 9th notes.Please try the demos provided!
